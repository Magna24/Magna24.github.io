Welcome to my personal website. I am a Research Director at the University of Chicago's [Education Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/education) and [Crime Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime). I am an applied microeconomist with work on education policy, labor markets, and health. I obtained my PhD in Economics at Northwestern University in 2022.
